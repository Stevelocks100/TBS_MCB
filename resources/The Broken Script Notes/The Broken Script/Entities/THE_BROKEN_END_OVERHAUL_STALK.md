Given that it's called "stalk", it likely has many different AIs

Initially appears as "calm" meaning that the face has a single white dot.
generic hurt sounds, immune to damage.

on spawn:
- sets weather to rainy
- kill after 18000 ticks
- check for player within 150 blocks
- if a player is within 3 blocks, 70% chance to despawn, stopsound @a, then wait 500 ticks to spawn [[THE_BROKEN_END]] (angry?)
- otherwise simply despawns, and places "physical stacktrace" block












### Appearance
initially i thought this entity was [[Hetzer]] but apparently not.
