### Initial Thoughts
Appears like a steve with exposure and a weird head design.
animations are mostly nothing, with the exception of chase and angry idle shaking.


### Behaviour:
- Default
	- has generic death and hurt sounds
	- invulnerable to player-related attacks
	- upon being killed:
		- unknown how to activate given that it is invulnerable to most attacks. false.
		- drops 16 occasionally
		- stops all sounds
		- drops other items, which cannot be determined. appears to be hardcoded, and not a datapack feature. appears to be a random assortment of cobblestone, redstone torches, and stone tools.
		- sends into chat: "DyeXD412 was slain by (player)" and "DyeXD412" left the game
	- upon being spawned:
		- plays a sound called "youknownothing"
		- breaks blocks under [[Circuit Breakable]]
	- executes something upon killing another player, but cannot be determined.
