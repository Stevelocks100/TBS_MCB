likely takes the appearance of a normal villager.

on spawn:
- likely gives itself an effect
- searches for entities, but reason is unknown.

on death:
- seems to spawn [[Circuit]]

on tick update:
- set target to iron golem within 50 blocks, otherwise player within 1000?
- very rare chance to die, and spawn [[Circuit]]
- very rare chance to simply die.



seems similar to pigCircuit, which likely means there is a fake pig mob.
